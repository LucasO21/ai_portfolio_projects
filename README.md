Welcome to my AI portfolio repository! This is a collection of hands-on AI projects designed to showcase practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. As a learning journey, each project explores different aspects of AI development, from natural language processing to intelligent assistants.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as both a learning playground and a portfolio showcase. Each project demonstrates:
- Real-world AI applications
- Modern AI development practices
- Integration of multiple AI technologies
- Problem-solving through intelligent systems

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Cannondale Bikes AI Assistant
**[üìÅ View Project](./src/cannondale_bikes_assistant/)**

An intelligent assistant that helps users find the perfect Cannondale bike based on their needs and preferences. This project demonstrates:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate product recommendations
- Interactive web interface for seamless user experience
- Vector database integration for efficient information retrieval
- Conversational AI powered by OpenAI's GPT models

**Key Features:**
- Natural language bike recommendations
- Product specification lookup
- Interactive chat interface
- Persistent conversation history

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **LangGraph**: Framework for building stateful AI applications
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for rapid prototyping
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Large language model for natural language understanding
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for semantic search
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for data persistence
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing LLM applications

## üêç Environment Setup

This project uses Conda for environment management to ensure consistent dependencies across different systems.

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed
- Python 3.9 or higher

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai_portfolio_projects
   ```

2. **Create a new Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n ai_portfolio python=3.9
   ```

3. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate ai_portfolio
   ```

4. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

### Running Projects

Each project includes its own README with specific running instructions. Generally:

```bash
# Navigate to a project directory
cd src/cannondale_bikes_assistant/

# Run the application (example for Streamlit apps)
streamlit run app/app.py
```

## üìñ Learning Resources

This repository demonstrates concepts from:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector Databases and Semantic Search
- Conversational AI
- Web Application Development

## üîÑ Continuous Learning

This repository is actively maintained and expanded as I explore new AI technologies and frameworks. Each project represents a step in my AI learning journey, with code that evolves and improves over time.

## üìù Notes

- All projects are designed for educational purposes
- Code includes extensive comments for learning reference
- Each project can be run independently
- Environment isolation ensures clean dependency management
